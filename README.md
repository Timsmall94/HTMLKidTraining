# HTMLKidTraining
This is the outcome of my HTML and CSS tutoring sessions for kids. As a tutor, I guide young learners through the basics of web development, helping them build foundational skills in HTML and CSS. This initiative aims to nurture the next generation of web creators, fostering their interest and proficiency in coding from an early age.
